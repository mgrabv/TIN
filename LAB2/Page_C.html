                <div class="article">
                    <p>Andre Romelle Young (born February 18, 1965), known professionally as 
                    Dr. Dre, is an American rapper, audio engineer, record producer, 
                    and businessman. He is the founder and CEO of Aftermath Entertainment 
                    and Beats Electronics, and previously co-founded, co-owned, and was 
                    the president of Death Row Records. Dr. Dre began his career as a 
                    member of the World Class Wreckin' Cru in 1985 and later found fame 
                    with the gangsta rap group <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N.W.A">
                    N.W.A.</a> The group popularized explicit lyrics 
                    in hip hop to detail the violence of street life. During the early 1990s, 
                    Dre was credited as a key figure in the crafting and popularization of 
                    West Coast G-funk, a subgenre of hip hop characterized by a synthesizer 
                    foundation and slow, heavy beats.</p>

                <div class="article">
                    <p>Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known 
                        professionally as Eminem (/ˌɛmɪˈnɛm/; formerly stylized as EMINƎM)
                        , is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. Eminem 
                        is among the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated 
                        worldwide sales of over 220 million records. He is credited with 
                        popularizing hip hop in Middle America and is critically acclaimed 
                        as one of the greatest rappers of all time.Eminem's global success 
                        and acclaimed works are widely regarded as having broken racial 
                        barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. 
                        While much of his transgressive work during the early 2000s made 
                        him hugely controversial, he came to be a representation of popular 
                        angst of the American underclass. He has been influential for many 
                        artists of various genres. After his debut album 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_(Eminem_album)">Infinite</a> (1996) 
                        and the extended play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slim_Shady_EP">Slim Shady EP</a>
                        (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved 
                        mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP. </p>
